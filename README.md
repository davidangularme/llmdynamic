Experimental Manipulation of Closed Language Model with Dynamic Attention Mechanism
Introduction
Today, I'd like to present an experimental language model that incorporates a custom dynamic attention mechanism. This project is currently in the research phase, and we are exploring new ways to improve the performance and efficiency of language models.

Overview of the Project
The goal of this project is to enhance the traditional GPT-2 model by introducing a dynamic attention mechanism. This mechanism allows for lazy updates to the attention weights, which can potentially reduce computational overhead and improve the model's performance.

Key Features
Dynamic Attention Mechanism: We have implemented a custom DynamicAttention class that extends the traditional attention mechanism used in GPT-2. This class supports lazy updates to the attention weights, which are applied only when a certain threshold is reached.
Integration with GPT-2: The custom attention mechanism is integrated into the GPT-2 model, allowing us to leverage the powerful pre-trained architecture while introducing our experimental modifications.
Flexible Generation Parameters: The model's text generation process can be fine-tuned using various parameters, such as temperature, top-k, top-p, and beam search, to control the diversity and coherence of the generated text.
